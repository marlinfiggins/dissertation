\abstract{%

Novel genetic variants are often produced due to mutations in circulating viral populations. 
These mutations can sometimes provide fitness advantages to members of the population allowing them to out-compete other variants through several mechanisms such as partial immune escape and increased transmissibility.
This interplay of mutation, transmission, and selection leads to evolution in the population.
Therefore, understanding the genetic composition of viral populations and its relation to virus phenotype can be useful for understanding the current and future epidemic potential of viral variants.

This dissertation develops several theoretical ideas, statistical methods, and software tools that enable evolutionary forecasting for SARS-CoV-2 and other rapidly evolving pathogens using concepts from population genetics, mathematical epidemiology, and statistics.

We begin by developing a Bayesian method for estimating the effective reproduction number of genetic variants using counts of variant sequences and measures of incidence such as case counts.

To evaluate this method among others, we develop a workflow to compare frequency-based forecast models in a live forecasting environment, quantifying the short-term accuracy of such methods and suggesting a minimal sequencing capacity to ensure high quality forecasts.

Next, we develop a larger theory for how mechanistic models of transmission constrain how variant frequencies change over time.
This leads to theoretical results for the trade-off between immune escape and increased transmissibility and suggests new methods for modeling variant fitness using approximate Gaussian processes as well as latent pseudo-immune factors.

We, then, apply these ideas to incorporate molecular data on immune escape and phylogenetic structure into relative fitness estimates to enable out-of-sample prediction of relative fitness from sequence-level predictors.

Our focus then shifts to the operational problem of evolutionary forecasting where we develop open-source software and visualization tools that can be used to implement, automate, and interpret evolutionary forecasts.

% \begin{glossary}
% \item[argument] replacement text which customizes a \LaTeX\ macro for
% each particular usage.
% \item[back-up] a copy of a file to be used when catastrophe strikes
% the original.  People who make no back-ups deserve
% no sympathy.
% \item[control sequence] the normal form of a command to \LaTeX.
% \item[delimiter] something, often a character, that indicates
% the beginning and ending of an argument.
% More generally, a delimiter is a field separator.
% \item[document class] a file of macros that tailors \LaTeX\ for
% a particular document.  The macros described by this thesis
% constitute a document class.
% \item[document option] a macro or file of macros
% that further modifies \LaTeX\ for
% a particular document.  The option {\tt[chapternotes]}
% constitutes a document option.
% \item[figure] illustrated material, including graphs,
% diagrams, drawings and photographs.
% \item[font] a character set (the alphabet plus digits
% and special symbols) of a particular size and style.  A couple of fonts
% used in this thesis are twelve point roman and {\sl twelve point roman
% slanted}.
% \item[footnote] a note placed at the bottom of a page, end of a chapter,
% or end of a thesis that comments on or cites a reference
% for a designated part of the text.
% \item[formatter] (as opposed to a word-processor) arranges printed
% material according to instructions embedded in the text.
% A word-processor, on the other hand, is normally controlled
% by keyboard strokes that move text about on a display.
% \item[\LaTeX] simply the ultimate in computerized typesetting.
% \item[macro]  a complex control sequence composed of 
% other control sequences.
% \item[pica] an archaic unit of length.  One pica is twelve points and
% six picas is about an inch.
% \item[point] a unit of length.  72.27 points equals one inch.
% \item[roman]  a conventional printing typestyle using serifs.
% the decorations on the ends of letter strokes.
% This thesis is set in roman type.
% \item[rule] a straight printed line; e.g., \hrulefill.
% \item[serif] the decoration at the ends of letter strokes.
% \item[table] information placed in a columnar arrangement.
% \item[thesis] either a master's thesis or a doctoral dissertation.
% This document also refers to itself as a thesis, although it
% really is not one.
