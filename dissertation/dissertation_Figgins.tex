\abstract{%

Novel genetic variants are often produced due to mutations in currently circulating virus populations. 
These mutations can sometimes provide fitness advantages to members of the population allowing them to out-compete other variants through several mechanisms such as partial immune escape, increased transmissibility, among others.
This interplay of mutation, transmission, and selection leads to evolution in the population.
Therefore, understanding the genetic composition of viral populations and its relation to virus phenotype can be useful for understanding the current and future epidemic potential of viral variants.

%TODO: Segement on SARS-CoV-2 

This dissertation develops some of the ideas underlying epidemic-evolutionary dynamics.

PROJECT 1: by developing a Bayesian method for estimating the effective reproduction number of genetic variants using counts of variant sequences and measures of incidence such as case counts.
%TODO: So what?

%TODO: Need to develop pop gen ideas better before this cuz this is first mention of frequency dynamics

PROJECT 2: We develop a larger theory for how mechanistic models of transmission constrain frequency dynamics.
This leads to theoretical results for the trade-off between immune escape and increased transmissibility 
also suggests a new non-parameteric estimator of variant fitness using approximate Gaussian processes 
%TODO: So what?

PROJECT 3: We, then, develop a workflow and framework to allow comparison between existing methods in a live forecasting environment, demonstrating the short-term accuracy of such methods and suggesting a minimal sequencing capacity to ensure high quality forecasts.
%TODO: So what?

PROJECT 4: Lastly, we apply these ideas to incorporate molecular level data on immune escape into relative fitness forecasts to enable out of sample prediction of variant relative fitness from sequence alone.

% \begin{glossary}
% \item[argument] replacement text which customizes a \LaTeX\ macro for
% each particular usage.
% \item[back-up] a copy of a file to be used when catastrophe strikes
% the original.  People who make no back-ups deserve
% no sympathy.
% \item[control sequence] the normal form of a command to \LaTeX.
% \item[delimiter] something, often a character, that indicates
% the beginning and ending of an argument.
% More generally, a delimiter is a field separator.
% \item[document class] a file of macros that tailors \LaTeX\ for
% a particular document.  The macros described by this thesis
% constitute a document class.
% \item[document option] a macro or file of macros
% that further modifies \LaTeX\ for
% a particular document.  The option {\tt[chapternotes]}
% constitutes a document option.
% \item[figure] illustrated material, including graphs,
% diagrams, drawings and photographs.
% \item[font] a character set (the alphabet plus digits
% and special symbols) of a particular size and style.  A couple of fonts
% used in this thesis are twelve point roman and {\sl twelve point roman
% slanted}.
% \item[footnote] a note placed at the bottom of a page, end of a chapter,
% or end of a thesis that comments on or cites a reference
% for a designated part of the text.
% \item[formatter] (as opposed to a word-processor) arranges printed
% material according to instructions embedded in the text.
% A word-processor, on the other hand, is normally controlled
% by keyboard strokes that move text about on a display.
% \item[\LaTeX] simply the ultimate in computerized typesetting.
% \item[macro]  a complex control sequence composed of 
% other control sequences.
% \item[pica] an archaic unit of length.  One pica is twelve points and
% six picas is about an inch.
% \item[point] a unit of length.  72.27 points equals one inch.
% \item[roman]  a conventional printing typestyle using serifs.
% the decorations on the ends of letter strokes.
% This thesis is set in roman type.
% \item[rule] a straight printed line; e.g., \hrulefill.
% \item[serif] the decoration at the ends of letter strokes.
% \item[table] information placed in a columnar arrangement.
% \item[thesis] either a master's thesis or a doctoral dissertation.
% This document also refers to itself as a thesis, although it
% really is not one.
