	dc.description = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused millions of deaths and substantial morbidity worldwide. Intense scientific effort to understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in daunting numbers of genomic sequences. We witnessed evolutionary events that could mostly be inferred indirectly before, such as the emergence of variants with distinct phenotypes, for example transmissibility, severity and immune evasion. This Review explores the mechanisms that generate genetic variation in SARS-CoV-2, underlying the within-host and population-level processes that underpin these events. We examine the selective forces that likely drove the evolution of higher transmissibility and, in some cases, higher severity during the first year of the pandemic and the role of antigenic evolution during the second and third years, together with the implications of immune escape and reinfections, and the increasing evidence for and potential relevance of recombination. In order to understand how major lineages, such as variants of concern (VOCs), are generated, we contrast the evidence for the chronic infection model underlying the emergence of VOCs with the possibility of an animal reservoir playing a role in SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and conclude that the former is more likely. We evaluate uncertainties and outline scenarios for the possible future evolutionary trajectories of SARS-CoV-2. In this Review, Markov, Katzourakis and colleagues explore the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 at different scales, the phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, factors that drive the evolution of the virus, theories for the emergence of epidemiologically important variants and potential future evolutionary scenarios and their likely health repercussions.},

              Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 18 years ago, a large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats 
              1--4 
              . Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans 
              5--7 
              . Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6\% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96\% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of . In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor---angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)---as SARS-CoV.},

AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the models for infectious diseases and highlights their values in the field of public health. This information will be of interest to mathematicians and clinicians, and make a significant contribution toward the development of more specific and effective models. Literature searches were performed using the online database of PubMed (inception to August 2020).
EXPERT OPINION: Modeling could contribute to infectious disease control by means of predicting the scales of disease epidemics, indicating the characteristics of disease transmission, evaluating the effectiveness of interventions or policies, and warning or forecasting during the pre-outbreak of diseases. With the development of theories and the ability of calculations, infectious disease modeling would play a much more important role in disease prevention and control of public health.},
